D-Bus 1.2.26 (21 December 2010)
==

• Fix for CVE-2010-4352: sending messages with excessively-nested variants can
  crash the bus. The existing restriction to 64-levels of nesting previously
  only applied to the static type signature; now it also applies to dynamic
  nesting using variants. Thanks to Rémi Denis-Courmont for discoving this
  issue.
• Corrected thread problem causing some calls to hang for 25s
• Enable address reuse on TCP sockets
• Fix use of $servicename in init script
