• Fix for CVE-2010-4352: sending messages with excessively-nested variants can

  nesting using variants. Thanks to Rémi Denis-Courmont for discoving this
  issue.
• Corrected thread problem causing some calls to hang for 25s
• Enable address reuse on TCP sockets
• Fix use of $servicename in init script
